"UNHCR’s global reporting standard for asylum statistics is for individual level data. To meet this standard, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shared the 2021 asylum data expressed in terms of individuals. Previously, USCIS provided data based on asylum “cases” and average family household size, which UNHCR used to estimate the total number of individual asylum applications before USCIS. The shift in 2021 to USCIS reporting of individuals (not cases) allows for more precise reporting, as well as more consistency across the U.S. asylum data, since the U.S. Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has already been reporting individual-level asylum statistics to UNHCR. UNHCR notes that the increase in the reported number of asylum applications filed with USCIS in 2021 primarily reflects this change in reporting modality.",2021,,USA,ASY
